This file is to showcase my knowledge of photoshop and the games I have created and worked on.

To play Led Astray, simply download the .exe and install it. This game was created in GameMaker so the code I wrote for it is not available as it was done at the school. All of the artwork was done by myself except for the floor tiles. The music and floor tiles were taken from a royalty free source. 

To play Led Astray, simply download the .exe and install it. This game was designed by myself and a team of 4 other people. We were each given a position in our mock game company and were tasked with completing a game by the end of the semester. My role in this project was that of a producer - to organize deliverables, set deadlines, plan meetings, and do what I could to help our team.

I have also included a Photoshop file of a character I was working on for an unfinished underwater game. This was included to showcase my knowledge of photoshop.
